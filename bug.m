In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, strong reference cycles can easily occur within blocks, leading to memory leaks. This happens when a block retains a strong reference to an object, and that object, in turn, retains a strong reference to the block, creating a circular dependency. Even if the object's original reference goes away, it won't be deallocated because of the cycle.
